Library Management System (Python Project)
Project Overview
This Python project is a simple Library Management System that stores, manages, and updates book records using a text file (library.txt). It allows users to:
-	Add new books
-	Display all books
-	Search for books
-	Borrow books
-	Return books
-	Save records automatically
Real-World Problem
Libraries often struggle to manage books manually, leading to missing records, difficulty in tracking issued/returned books, and time-consuming searches. A digital automated system makes book records organized and easy to manage.
Objectives
-	Build a simple library system using Python.
-	Store data using text files.
-	Allow users to add, search, borrow, and return books.
-	Practice Python functions, loops, file handling, and data structures.
Expected Outcomes
-	A fully functional library management program.
-	Understanding of file handling in Python.
-	Ability to create menu-driven applications.
Tools & Python Concepts Used Python Concepts:
-	Functions
-	Conditionals
-	Lists & Dictionaries
-	Loops
-	File Handling- String operations
Tools:
-	Python (VS Code, PyCharm)
-	Text file as database (library.txt)
Project Structure
LibraryManagement/
-	library.py (main program)
-	library.txt (auto-created data file)
-	README.pdf (documentation)
How to Run
1.	Install Python.
2.	Save the code as library.py.
3.	Run: python library.py
